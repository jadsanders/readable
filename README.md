# Readable Project by Oliver Mayer

This is the working application of the Readable project in the Udacity React Nanodegree course.

# Installation

1. Clone this repository with git clone https://github.com/jadsanders/readable.git
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start

# Server API

In order for this frontend to work you have to install the provided server API.

1. Clone this repository with git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter
2. Run npm install
3. Run node server


# How it works

The server already provides some pre-populated blogposts. You can edit or delete them if you want. If you want to add new blogposts just click on "New Post" on the home screen.

The rest of the app is very intuitive and self-explanatory (I hope). ;-)

Enjoy!
